#' @title Delete Records From a Project
#'
#' @description Delete records from a project.  This is a destructive action that
#'   will result in deletion of any events and data associated with the arm.
#'   Data loss is non-reversible.  The user must have 'Delete Record' privileges
#'   in the database.
#'
#' @param rcon A REDCap connection object as generated by
#'   \code{redcapConnection}.
#' @param records a vector of record names to be deleted.
#' @param arms \code{integerish}, the arm number of the arm in which the
#'   record(s) should be deleted. (This can only be used if the project is
#'   longitudinal with more than one arm.) NOTE: If the arm parameter is not
#'   provided, the specified records will be deleted from all arms in which
#'   they exist. Whereas, if arm is provided, they will only be deleted from
#'   the specified arm.
#' @param error_handling An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
#'   see \code{\link{redcap_error}}
#' @param ... Additional arguments to pass to other methods.
#'
#' @section REDCap API Documentation:
#' This method allows you to delete one or more records from a project in a
#' single API request.
#'
#' @section REDCap Version:
#' At least 8.1.17+ (and likely some earlier versions)
#'
#' @return
#' The number of deleted records.
#'
#' @references
#' Please refer to your institution's API documentation.
